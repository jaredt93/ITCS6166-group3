# ITCS 6166: Computer Comm & Networks - Project
Group Number: 3

Group Members: Jared Tamulynas, Akhil Pravardhan Manneni, Rakesh Anumula, Sai Rohit Madapathi

## Project Objective
To investigate the role of AI (specifically generative AI and reinforcement learning) in improving networking performance. The project focuses on using minimal network bandwidth to achieve high-quality video streaming services.

## Key Deliverables

### Selected Paper
BoB: Bandwidth Prediction for Real-Time Communications Using Heuristic and Reinforcement Learning

[BoB Repository](https://github.com/NUStreaming/BoB)

### Code Replication
Objective: Teams replicate results using the code associated with their selected paper.

Minimum requirement: Run test/inference codes.

### Video Streaming Application 
Objective: Teams build a video streaming application with a sender and receiver using a real-time networking protocol (e.g., webRTC).
